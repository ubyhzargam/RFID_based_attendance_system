This was a project done by a team of 4 members. This was done in my 1st year of engineering. We used a RFID tag (card) and RFID card reader to identify the student uniquely through his card. We used Real time clock to know the attendance in real time. We used Arduino UNO for this project. A buzzer would ring and red LED would glow in case the student access is denied or if access is not granted. Green LED would glow if access is granted.
